# Phase 3 RCT/Phase 2 Impact Evaluation TRIAL TITLE HERE
### Country Year Evaluation Type (e.g. Kenya LR2018 RCT)

*In this section, give a brief introduction to the trial: the context and the decisions that will be made/goal of the analysis*

### Hypotheses

This trial aims to validate or refute the following hypotheses:

+ **H1**:
+ **H2**:

### Trial Design

*In this section, add in more detail about how the trial was designed (e.g. which districts, how randomization happened)**


### Survey Methodology 

*In this section, describe the survey methodology: how many surveys, what questions were asked that will be used for the analysis, the frequency, any methodology changes mid-survey*



## Data Cleaning

*import and clear all variables here and briefly describe the steps you are taking for transparency*

```{r data.cleaning}







```

## Data Checking

### Balance

*Number in treatment groups and number in control groups*

```{r data.checking.balance}

num.t.c.farmers <- data.frame(c("Treatment", "Control"), c(100,100))
colnames(num.t.c.farmers) <-c("Sample", "N")

kable(num.t.c.farmers,table.attr = "class=\"yellow\"", align=rep('c', 5), digits=2, caption="Number of Farmers by Study Group")

```


### Duplicates

*Check for duplicate entries and verify whether or not they are true duplciates*


### Attrition

*If applicable, check how many farmers requested to be dropped from baseline and after the survey began. Also check the number of surveys that each farmer actually completed*

```{r data.checking.attrition.1}

attrition.percent <- data.frame(c("Treatment", "Control"), c(100,100), c(10,8), c(.1, .08))
colnames(attrition.percent) <-c("Sample", "Total Farmers", "Number of Attritors", "% Attrition")

knitr::kable(attrition.percent,table.attr = "class=\"orange\"", align=rep('c', 5), digits=2, caption="Number of Farmers by Study Group")


```

### Any other data checking can go here

*e.g. if there were potential fradulent entries, or farmers who didn't get the sanitary pads*


# H1 Analysis

### Data Exploration

*put a couple tables showing summary statistics and a boxplot/violin and density plot here or any other relevant graphs*

### Outliers

*check for outliers here for the H1 variables. If there are outliers, you will run the regression both with and without the outliers*

### Analysis


# Summary of Results

*Add a couple of the key points at the end here and a couple key graphs. Basically, if Patrick or Jan wanted to see the results, this is the only thing they should have to look at.*


# Appendix

### H1 Regression Ouptut

*Print regression diagnostic plots here*
